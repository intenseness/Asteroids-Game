# Attack of the Pizzas

The Broccoli will shoot lazers at the moving pizzas. The Broccoli will move around and dodge pizzas. When the broccoli shoots a whole pizza, smaller pesonal size pizzas are created. As you shoot more large whole pizzas more small personal size pizzas fill up the screen resulting in more difficult gameplay. The user must continue to dodge the slices and shoot them. Points are acrued as the user continues to destroy the pizzas. While all of this is going on, alien pizza slices will be firing lazers at the user, (which the user will have to dodge) and moving around. The user will have to dodge the pizzas and the blasts from the alien slices while trying to destroy the alien slices as well.
